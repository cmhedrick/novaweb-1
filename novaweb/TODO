Bugs:
  -- Should require special permission to Submit a timesheet on behalf of another user.
  -- Deactivating a user should remove that user from all contracts
  -- A deactivated user should not show up in (modify users contracts) list.

TODO:
  -- Email Timesheet Reminders

Extras:
  -- Only make flash() disappear if overwritten by .js
  -- default flash() should "roll up" into hidden bar ( +------------------ ) instead
  -- Add discount/subtotal support. Discounts - per contract, or per invoice?
