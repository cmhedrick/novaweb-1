Bugs:
  -- Should require special permission to Submit a timesheet on behalf of another user.
  -- Deactivating a user should remove that user from all contracts
  -- A deactivated user should not show up in (modify users contracts) list.


TODO:
  -- Email Timesheet Reminders
  -- Audit Logs
  -- Add ability to specify which payperiod you want to view in def payperiod() (currently set to "oldest one outstanding")
    -- Include navigation to go backwards and forwards(up to current only)
    -- link from manage payperiod
  -- create invoice pdf

Extras:
  -- Only make flash() disappear if overwritten by .js
  -- default flash() should "roll up" into hidden bar ( +------------------ ) instead
  -- Add discount/subtotal support. Discounts - per contract, or per invoice?


Styling Todo Requests:
payperiod_content li -> inline, add js to show/hide alternate divs


Currently Working on :
payperiod -> contracts view and processing
